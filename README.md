# grohe-ondus-api-java

This is a library written in Java which can communicate to the Grohe ONDUS API interface, e.g. to request appliance data or to send commands.

# API reference

The API used by the Grohe ONDUS App is not publicly documented or released. The implementation of this library is basically based on
information gathered while reverse engineering the Grohe ONDUS Anroid App. This means, that the use of this API with this library
may not be permitted by Grohe and that this library may not work in the future anymore (when Grohe changes the API interface without
any backwards compatibility). Once Grohe releases a public API, this library may not be needed anymore.
